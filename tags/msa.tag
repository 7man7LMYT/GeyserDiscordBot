Since December 1st, all new Minecraft accounts are now using the new Microsoft Account system, which currently isn't supported by Geyser. We're actively working on a fix, please stay patient while we get the system implemented. We'll likely make a GeyserNews announcement when the fix is released, so if you'd like to be notified, you can run `!rank GeyserNews` in <#613194762249437245>.
