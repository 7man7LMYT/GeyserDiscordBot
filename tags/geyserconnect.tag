There is an **Unofficial** public [GeyserConnect](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserConnect) instance running. You can connect to it via
Address: `geyserconnect.gq`
Port: `17193`

**Warning:** Due to Geyser handling certain things different to a vanilla Java client you may get banned using this (see `!tag anticheat` for more info). As well as this, if you use online mode you are sending your Java account credentials to a third party.
