This module is based on the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) Discord bot version check feature as seen [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-discord-bot/tree/master/versioncheck). It uses the same method names and designs but has been altered slightly to better fit our use case and work with Node.js
